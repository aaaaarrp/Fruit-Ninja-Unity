# Fruit Ninja

> Fruit Ninja is a mobile game developed by Halfbrick Studios that released in April 2010 on the iOS App Store. In Fruit Ninja, the player slices fruit with a blade controlled via the touch screen. As the fruit is thrown onto the screen, the player swipes their finger across the screen to create a slicing motion, attempting to slice the fruit in half.

In this clone version, Instead of touching, one can use a mouse to move the blade to slice the fruits. We can see the points on the screen after every slicing.
